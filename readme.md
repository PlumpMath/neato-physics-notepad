# graphical equation manipulator, Scala edition

I had the idea for this software when I was 19, but I wasn't a good enough programmer to make it. You can see my first attempt 
on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16eiGLrX248) 
(featuring an Australian accent much stronger than the one I have after living in the US for a few years).

I'm going to do it in Scala, because type systems make it much easier for me to think about what I'm doing.
