# Notes on "Fundamentals of Physics"

Good showing-off problems:

-


Interesting ones:

- Chapter 11: Rotation
  - During the time interval t the flywheel of a generator has the angle theta = at + bt^3 - ct^4, where a, b, and c are constants. Write expressions for the wheel's angular velocity and angular acceleration.
    - This requires creating equations and differentiation.
  - What is the angular speed of the minute hand of a clock, in radians per second?
  - There's a spinning 8-spoke wheel. You want to shoot an arrow through it. How fast does the arrow need to be going?
  - Of Sec 11-2, feature relevances:
    - diagrams:
    - nonstandard units: 2
    - create equations: 2
    - differentiation: 3
    - none: 2
  - Sec 11-4
    - none: 5
    - quadratic equations: 3
- Chapter 12: Rolling, Torque, and Angular Momentum
  - Sec 12-10 56P: A 30kg child stands on the edge of a stationary merry-go-round of mass 100kg and radius 2m. The rotational inertia of the merry-go-round around its axis is 150kg m^2. The child catches a ball of mass 1.0kg thrown by a friend. Just before the ball is caught, it has a horizontal velocity of 12m/s that makes an angle of 37Â° with a line tangent to the outer edge of the merry-go-round. What is the angular speed of the merry-go-round just after the ball is caught?
  - 53P: If the ice caps melted, what effect would that have on the length of the day?
  - also 59P
- Chapter 27: Current and Resistance
  - features:
    - weird units: 1
    - none: 5
  - A current of 5.0 A exists in a 10 Ohm resister for 4 minutes. How many coulombs and electrons pass through any cross section of the resistor in this time?




Different features these depend on:

- Creating equations
- Triangle diagrams
- Differentiation
- Nonstandard units
