    <p>Welcome to my Neato Physics Notebook! (Let me know if you think of a better name.)
    This is a tool that I've wanted since I was 19; back then I wasn't good enough at
    programming to make a version that's worth using. I recently decided to rewrite it, and
    I think the result is much better than my first try.
    </p>

    <p>At the moment, I don't have a better way of teaching you how to use this software than
    recommending that you watch <a href="https://youtu.be/RWPHu8Vynv8">this video</a>, preferably
    following along with the app while you're watching the video.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions or comments, please let me know at bshlegeris@gmail.com.</p>
